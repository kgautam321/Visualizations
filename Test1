Desire for exception based reporting
We change the business in field so frequently, its not simple to keep It aligned

need to track new metrics based on business changes

Add new lines in 13 week report
new requests come in that make some additinal changes to add and remove lines
its a constantly updated report. Not necessarily a bad things
information and metrics that the operaion needs can be delivered in a different way. Requires a change in culture.
changing culture around busness to enable self -sufficency
are there opportunies to consume data into other ways.
getting bsuiness to shift to newer consumption layers might be more challenging

exception based reporting. Might still be challenging
action based reporting
we dont need a report for everything. business needs to bo on board to be able to seve themselves. 
plan to educate and guage the appetite from business for self-serve


it would be nice if we have some centralized data to do adhoc-query by business themselves
number of dashboards, reports are too many. yet the number of reports to be developed are still ob the rise
needs a shift in the culture around delivery and consumption of data

field goes to the sharepoint list to consume the reports

15-20 dashboards
  95% are tableau

metrics about usage can be obtained from Tableau server. Sharepoint does not have such feature.

lot of reports where they may not be used when people leave.
needs to users change over time but they don't necessarily change reports, they combine multiple reports and paste into other reporting.
multiple versions of the similar reports

customer asks for reports - no clear idea on guidance how to build it
sometimes adhoc reporting turns into on-going usage. 
The sharepoint list has reports from both usiness and IT delivered reports. Finiding report ownership is issue when business develops reports and new people are on-boarded.

No UX design with the end users.
IT designs and builds reports and then iteratively change it
IT would like to have inputs from business around wireframing with business before building new reports.
Business Analysts sometime sometimes know based on experience what the end users might need and create Mockups.

planning reports ? Not used. users just use some vendor tools for planning and budgeting.

Within some buisness units a lot of manual work is being done to publish the reports.
There is no annotation done on any reports today to save any kind of commentary around numbers.

NLP chatbot could be another channel in the future for self-serve data, but needs underlying technologies and processes to be ready first for data hub, governance etc. Will not need this in near future.

Salesforce also has interface to consume reports. they just want the data and create reports within salesforce

Strengths - No red tape.
          - deversity of people with strengths in various reporting technologies
          - business is lot more data led than 5 years ago
          - lot of reports built around vendor processes to identify issues with their feeds

Roles are maintained in sharepoint for field operations for exeutive notebooks etc..
