Workshop Infrastructure/DevOps

Pain point:
   Because of cloud initiatves
   Eq. Hadoop hortonworks on EC2 was implemented that was taken out
EC2 instances : Kaka, Nifi  for streaming
Loves.com migration to Azure. More AWS work in the future.
Build first and then try to put a strategy around it
Nice : Provision new servers, scale out 
Private internal cloud using Vmware VRA. Lot of effort.
More vendors are supporting more features on cloud only.
Azure and AWS are currently being used. Not enough enperience to have seen many pain paoints yet.
Snowflake is on Amazon because Azure wasn’t supported at the time it was implemented.
Mulesoft instance is on AWS
Cycone : strongly recommend Azure. PaasS, WebApps, Databases(Managed).
           
Virtue stream : 3rd party cloud hosting . ECC and BW are on it. Lots of issues related to stability, scale , networking.
Office365: unable to fully embrace  due to cultural issues. like downtime of e-mail etc.
All SQL server databases will stay on prem
The hardware for EDW, RightAngle, HANA will be ed of life soon and will need to decide if they need to be deployed into cloud.
EDW might go away and move to Driver360 in snowflake

Manthan 
In a couple of years everything might be on cloud except for sensitive data that might be backed up on prem. 
A lot of vendor databases are based on whatever supported by vendor.
There is no cloud first initiative and no intention to migrate anytime soon.

Internal cloud : Love’s cloud services VRA


Support model: standard support model, helpdesk, skype. Desktop support team. IT operations center.

Dev environment.QA and Production
All developers have sysadmin in Dev. 
QA – it has to go thru code review and hand off.
     4 people that perform code review for database.
    Promoted to QA. 
    Schema compare within SQL to get change script for validations using visual studio.
    Testing in QA.
    NRC is created. Approved and moved to production using same schema compare

No equivalent in snowflake for dev/qa. Using another tool DBT for generating change script.
 
CI/CD pipeline
   Some old stuff is on TFS. Newer projects are all on Azure DevOps
   Snowflake there is no dev/qa environment

Costs : largest cost is server licensing for SQL. You can’t buy small increments by 5-10 cores, you have to buy 24,48 cores etc

In some cases, vendors don’t support virtualization. But it has still been done and worked ok.

Business does understand that the costs associated with servers/licensing etc is to support their processes and are supportive. No cost restrictions.

Most requests are for storage Adds and its pretty straightforward. No real issues with performance.

A lot of business processes depend on e-mail and NAS shares.

No disaster recovery in place today for on-prem datacenter except for AJB – credit card has a backup in an offsite location. It’s a business decision to not have this because of costs.

Daily full backups. For transactional log every 15 min. All scheduled by agent on network share that are backed to a secondary data center.

SQL AG for High availability.
Applications have FI/load balancer.
Customer facing applications usually have multiple servers.

Loves.com on azure has HA and DR
SAP ECC and BW will soon have an HA and DR

Looking to hire additional people to help with Cloud initiatives for infrastructure.

Open to using multiple clouds based on applications
No current strategy to move to one cloud since each business or vendors have different expertise with different clouds.

Not using any containers/docker/kubernetes.

Sizing
  For existing projects Sizing based on utilization in peak windows.
  For new projects Gut feel and vendor recommended

Everything is overprovisioned to some extent to support applications
There is no chargeback model to business for infrastructure costs.
There is no SLA defined with the business.

Service catalog available for self service of VM sorage extension.
  
What strategies are in place for system upgrades ? How is this managed without impact to Business projects.
Monthly patches for OS 
Rest are coordinated with Business based on downtime requirements
Pre-prod 10 days before upgrade and 10 days later production servers are upgraded. All dev/qa/prod are all upgraded at the same time.

Applications: build new and upgrade. Minor ones work with vendors 

Parallel systems available for a couple days with upgraded and old systems to identify any issues.
